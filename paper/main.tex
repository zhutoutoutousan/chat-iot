\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the integration of domain-specific knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) through vector databases, focusing on energy infrastructure data analysis. We present a novel approach combining PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and vector databases to enhance LLMs' understanding of specialized energy sector data. Our methodology demonstrates improved performance in handling complex energy infrastructure queries while maintaining computational efficiency. The results indicate significant improvements in both query response times and accuracy when compared to traditional approaches, particularly in processing MaStR data and related energy infrastructure documentation.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Current LLM implementations face significant limitations in processing domain-specific knowledge, particularly in specialized fields such as energy infrastructure analysis. These limitations become especially apparent when dealing with complex structured data like MaStR (Marktstammdatenregister) and related energy infrastructure documentation.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The integration of complex structured data from sources like MaStR presents unique challenges, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Real-time querying requirements for large-scale infrastructure data
\item Multi-lingual context challenges, particularly in German-English translations
\item Efficient processing of domain-specific technical information
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Objectives}
Our research aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate vector database performance for domain-specific data
\item Compare various embedding strategies for energy infrastructure information
\item Assess multi-lingual capabilities in technical contexts
\item Measure real-world application effectiveness
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Vector Database Evolution}
Vector databases have evolved significantly since the introduction of FAISS in 2017, with modern systems offering improved capabilities for high-dimensional vector management and optimization techniques for nearest neighbor search. The integration patterns with LLMs have become increasingly sophisticated, enabling more efficient processing of domain-specific information.

\subsection{Energy Data Analytics}
Current energy infrastructure analysis systems face limitations in processing complex data structures, particularly when dealing with MaStR data. These limitations affect both data processing efficiency and the accuracy of analytical outcomes.

\subsection{Multi-Database Architectures}
Our research implements a hybrid approach combining:
\begin{itemize}
\item PostgreSQL for structured relational data
\item TimescaleDB for temporal data management
\item Vector databases for semantic search capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Architecture}
\subsubsection{Multi-Database Design}
Our architecture incorporates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Milvus vector database with IVF FLAT indexing
\item 1024-dimensional vector embeddings using SBERT
\item Document chunking strategy: 500-word blocks with 20-word overlap
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Processing Pipeline}
The pipeline includes:
\begin{equation}
c_i = \arg\min_c \sum_{x\in C_i} \|x - c\|^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
d(x, q) = \|x - q\|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^D (x_i - q_i)^2}
\end{equation}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Database Construction}
The implementation focuses on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimized schema design for energy infrastructure data
\item Vector database configuration for efficient querying
\item Integration of multi-lingual capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Results \& Analysis}
\subsection{Performance Metrics}
Our evaluation includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Query response time benchmarking
\item Accuracy measurements using Vicuna-13B as evaluator
\item Comparative analysis with GPT-3.5 baseline
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The results demonstrate significant improvements in both query response times and accuracy when compared to traditional approaches. The integration of vector databases shows particular promise in handling complex energy infrastructure queries.

\section{Conclusion}
Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of vector databases in enhancing LLMs' domain-specific knowledge processing capabilities, particularly in the context of energy infrastructure analysis. Future work will focus on scaling these improvements and expanding the application to other specialized domains.
